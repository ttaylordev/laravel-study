# PHP Laravel Study Project

This is a quick practice exercise I did to familiarize myself with the Laravel framework. Having come from a javascript background with experience in Angular and React, I am fairly new to PHP. This should be an interesting exercise. I am loosely following Edwin Diaz's PHP Laravel course to get me started.
